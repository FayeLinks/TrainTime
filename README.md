# TrainTime
Yee-haw, get along little doggies!

In this project I created an Old West themed train schedule using tools such as html, css, javscript and a new tool I'd not worked with called Firebase.

I didn't have an issue with the layout of the webpage, but I did really struggle with getting the train times to display under their proper table head.

The math for calculating the train arrival time and minutes left was very tricky, but I was able to get it functioning correctly.

All aboard the Wild West Train Station!
